    This function computes the filter coefficients for a bank of
    Gammatone filters. These filters were defined by Patterson and Holdworth for
    simulating the cochlea.

    The result is returned as a :class:`ERBCoeffArray`. Each row of the
    filter arrays contains the coefficients for four second order filters. The
    transfer function for these four filters share the same denominator (poles)
    but have different numerators (zeros). All of these coefficients are
    assembled into one vector that the ERBFilterBank can take apart to implement
    the filter.

    The filter bank contains "numChannels" channels that extend from
    half the sampling rate (fs) to "lowFreq". Alternatively, if the numChannels
    input argument is a vector, then the values of this vector are taken to be
    the center frequency of each desired filter. (The lowFreq argument is
    ignored in this case.)

    Note this implementation fixes a problem in the original code by
    computing four separate second order filters. This avoids a big problem with
    round off errors in cases of very small cfs (100Hz) and large sample rates
    (44kHz). The problem is caused by roundoff error when a number of poles are
    combined, all very close to the unit circle. Small errors in the eigth order
    coefficient, are multiplied when the eigth root is taken to give the pole
    location. These small errors lead to poles outside the unit circle and
    instability. Thanks to Julius Smith for leading me to the proper
    explanation.

    Execute the following code to evaluate the frequency response of a 10
    channel filterbank::

        fcoefs = MakeERBFilters(16000,10,100);
        y = ERBFilterBank([1 zeros(1,511)], fcoefs);
        resp = 20*log10(abs(fft(y')));
        freqScale = (0:511)/512*16000;
        semilogx(freqScale(1:255),resp(1:255,:));
